# hello-world
Hello world is a demo repo to learn about GitHub repo creating. 
## A repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. 

## creating a brach:
Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
default branch called "main" and the new branch called "readme-edits".

## Making and commiting changes:
>You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
